This application users find songs and artists through keyword search and engage further with these artists by finding more music, accessing their live events, or purchasing their merchandise. 

Users can find songs by subject, specific lyrics, song titles, or artist names, and read additional information about the song or artist. From there, the application provides links to concerts and events coming up, as well as merchandise purchasing options which might be of interest to the user. 

By using this application, you are one quick search away from finding your new favorite artist, making plans to see them live, and buying a few new pieces of swag to show your support.

This group project is an attempt to create an interactive site that will allow the user to find a Restaurant that they are interested in visiting and finding out the rating of their restroom facilities.  Why is it important to know about a restaurants restroom facilities.  "Restaurants of any size are regulated by a variety of local, state and federal laws dealing with health and safety for customers and employees. A critical component of restaurant design is providing restrooms for customers and employees, and for both men and women in each category. This includes the physical facilities and signage, as well as provision for handicapped or wheelchair access." (https://smallbusiness.chron.com/restroom-requirements-restaurants-41132.html)  Although establishments may follow these minimum guidelines some facilities are better than others (family facilities; gender neutral facilities; the cleanliness of the stalls).  Why wouldn't you want to know before hand if the restroom is an acceptable place for you and your family/ friends to YiPEE.

In Project 1 a group of students (Mandy Lloyd, Sarah Kerr, and Kenya Allen) are tasked with building a web application from scratch. Our team, has conceived and executed a design that solves the real- world problem of "Are your restroom facilities appropriate for my/ our needs as guests.  The YiPEE application receives data from multiple server-side API requests (API #1 and API #2). Because we worked collaboratively, we learned agile development methodologies and implemented features and bug fixes using the git branch workflow and pull requests.
=======
In this application users will locate a restaurant based on their food preferences for the evening and then search that restaurants restroom ratings.  

By using this application, you are one quick search away from finding knowing if the restaurant that you will be socializing in meets all of your YiPEE needs.
